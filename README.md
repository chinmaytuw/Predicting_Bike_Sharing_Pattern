# Bike Sharing Prediction using Neural Network

# Introduction - Business Problem:
As a bike sharing company we need to predict how many bikes we will need in the near future. Few of the reasons are:
  - If we have a higher supply of bikes and lower demand, it will add to our OPEX.
  - If we have a lower supply than demand, then we loose on profits.

# Design Overview:
We will build a neural network from scratch and implement feedforward and backpropogation using stochastic gradient descent. 
Later we will test out the network's efficacy on unseen data.
